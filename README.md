                                'op1=>operation: My Operation\n' + 
                                'sub1=>subroutine: My Subroutine\n' + 
                                'cond=>condition: Yes \n' + 
                                'or No?\n:>http://www.google.com' +

                                'cond(yes)->io->e\n' + // conditions can also be redirected like cond(yes, bottom) or cond(yes, right)
                                'cond(no)->sub1->op1');
  diagram.drawSVG('diagram');

  // you can also try to pass options:
  
  diagram.drawSVG('diagram', {
                                'line-width': 3,
                                'line-length': 50,
